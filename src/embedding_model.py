"""Embedding model wrapper.

Keeps the rest of the code independent of which sentence-transformer is used;
only this module (and the registry it reads) knows about model names, the
prompt each family expects, and which device the weights land on.

Two things here are easy to get wrong and expensive to get wrong:

**Prompts.** E5 and Qwen3-style embedders were trained asymmetrically — the
query side carries a prefix the document side does not.  Encoding both the
same way puts questions and passages in slightly different regions of the
space and quietly costs recall, with no error anywhere to notice.  The
prefixes come from ``src/model_registry.py``, which copied them from each
model's own config.

**Sequence length.** sentence-transformers takes the tokenizer's maximum,
which for Qwen3 is 32k tokens.  Attention is quadratic, so a model that
would encode a 300-token chunk in milliseconds instead reserves buffers for
a context 100x longer than anything in this corpus.  The registry caps it.
